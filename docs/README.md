![image](https://github.com/uakbr/Tesla-Distributed-GPU-Inference/assets/62894286/5610c429-640e-4443-a03e-7cad384b64c4)


## Overview
This project harnesses the GPU power of Tesla vehicles to create a scalable and efficient distributed inference system. It's designed to optimize computational tasks across a networked fleet, enhancing fault tolerance, data security, and dynamic load management.

## Features
- **Distributed Computing**: Utilize Tesla vehicles' GPUs for distributed data processing.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Dynamic task redistribution and real-time node recovery.
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption and secure boot features.
- **Performance Optimization**: Load balancing and network optimization for maximum efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Access to a Tesla vehicle fleet or a simulated environment
- Network capabilities

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/distributed-inference-tesla-fleet.git
cd distributed-inference-tesla-fleet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
Modify the configuration settings in `src/common/config.py` to tailor the system parameters like network settings, GPU utilization, and security protocols to your environment.

## Usage
Start the server and deploy the vehicle node script:
```bash
# Start the server
python src/server/server_main.py

# Deploy to each vehicle
python src/vehicle/vehicle_main.py
```

## Architecture
For a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture, including component interactions and data flow, refer to [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development
### Testing
Ensure the system's integrity with:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
