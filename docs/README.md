# Distributed Inference System Across Tesla Fleet

## Overview
This project implements a robust, scalable, and efficient distributed inference system utilizing the GPU compute power of Tesla vehicles. The system is designed to optimize computational efficiency across a networked fleet, addressing challenges such as fault tolerance, data security, and dynamic load management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`
- Access to a simulated environment or actual Tesla vehicle fleet with network capabilities

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/distributed-inference-tesla-fleet.git
   ```
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration
Edit the `src/common/config.py` file to set up network parameters, GPU settings, and other system configurations as per your deployment environment.

## Usage
To launch the system:
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python src/server/server_main.py
   ```
2. Deploy the vehicle node script to each vehicle in the fleet:
   ```bash
   python src/vehicle/vehicle_main.py
   ```
